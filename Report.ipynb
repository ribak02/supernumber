    "## 1. Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "For this practical we were asked to work as a team of Research Software Engineers that had been contacted by a mathematician. The topic of research the mathematician was interested in was supernumbers. Therefore, we had to create a supernumbers implementation with all of the necessary functions and properties. We then had to set up automated testing to enable the mathematician to check certain properties. We implemented the basic requirements and all extensions. We took care to document and test our code exhaustively, achieving 100% test coverage and 100% documentation coverage excluding nested functions and unit tests.\n",

    "## 2. Design & Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Our implementation is split into several files:\n",
    "* `core.py` provides the core implementation of the `SuperNumber` and `SuperNumbers` classes.\n",
    "* `props.py` and `props_supernumbers.py` provide two equivalent implementations of several functions that determine properties of a set of supernumbers. `props_checked.py` has the same interface, but uses both implementations and checks the results.\n",
    "* `span.py` implements the set span algorithm.\n",
    "* `supernumber.py` exports everything from one file for convenient usage by the researcher.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `SuperNumber` and `SuperNumbers`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `SuperNumber` and `SuperNumbers` classes are fairly straightforward implementations of the classes specified in the basic requirements and first Medium extension of the spec, respectively. A few notes on our implementation decisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The spec leaves open the question of how the `SuperNumber` and `SuperNumbers` constructors should handle numbers or multipliers larger than the modulus value. We decided to simply silently apply the modulus; this simplifies the implementation of `SuperRootsOfOne`, whose definition depends on `<1 mod 1>` being equivalent to `<0 mod 1>`.\n",
    "* In addition to the required methods, `SuperNumbers` implements a method, `iter_below`, that takes a supernumber and returns an iterator of every member of the set whose underlying number is less than the argument. This allows us to do something similar to the `for x in range(10) for y in range(x)` pattern, used in several of the functions in `props.py`, in `props_supernumbers.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "We provided two different implementations of `HasSuperNumberIdempotentProperty`, `IsCommutativeSuperNumberMultiplication`, `IsAssociativeSuperNumberMultiplication`, and `SuperRootsOfOne`. The first implementation, in `props.py`, uses `SuperNumber` directly; the second, in `props_supernumbers.py`, uses the `SuperNumbers` abstraction. Finally, `props_checked.py` has the same interface as the other two files, but calls both implementations and asserts that the result is equal before returning it. This final module is the one used to generate the results shown in this report.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Set Spans\n",
    "\n",
    "`SuperNumberSetSpan`, given a set of supernumbers (the \"generators\", no relation to the Python language feature), finds the set of supernumbers that can be obtained by multiplying together the generators in various combinations. The implementation works by taking the initial set of generators (which are trivially part of the span), multiplying each known result by each of the generators, and repeating until the set of known results stops growing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation assumes supernumber multiplication is commutative. If it were not, we would need to test multiplying supernumbers together both ways, complicating our implementation slightly. Luckily, based on our preliminary findings, this doesn't seem to be something we have to worry about. Nevertheless, as we haven't formally proven that this is the case, `SuperNumberSetSpan` includes an assertion to ensure that this is the case—and, therefore, we can return a correct result—for the given n and alpha."

    "We implemented a suite of unit tests in `Code/UnitTests.py`, containing a total of 45 tests, our code with 100% coverage. For the two implementations of props, we use a base class, `PropsTests`, with a set of test cases, and subclass it to test the two concrete implementations. There's a bit of trickery in making this work: if we made `PropsTests` a subclass of `TestCase`, unittest would treat it as a test case in its own right and try to execute it. To get around this, the base class doesn't descend from `TestCase`; instead, the two concrete classes use multiple inheritance to descend from both `PropsTests` and `TestCase`.\n",

    "Additionally, `props_checked` verifies that results are consistent across the two implementations of `props`, so any end-user usage of `props_checked` (including this report) serves as some additional testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the properties tests are run using at least one trivial case and one non-trivial case. There is a proof provided for all of the trivial cases in the comments above the trivial case to show that the properties functions are correct. For the commutative property, the trivial case uses a mod of 2 and an alpha of 0 because can only differentiate between the ordering of 2 values if they are different values. Using a mod of 2 means there are two possible values: 1 and 0 but using a mod of 1 only has the value 0 so you can't differentiate between 0 * 0 and 0 * 0. All of the other properties use the trivial case of mod = 1 and alpha = 0 as you don't need to differentiate between two different values. For example, with the `test_associative` function which is testing the `IsAssociativeSuperNumberMultiplication` property the trivial case used is mod = 1 and alpha = 0 and the non-trivial case used is mod = 4 and alpha = 5.\n",

    "This practical was very different to anything we have completed before as we have never written research software or had experience working with research software.

However, we did complete all of the basic and extension requirements so this shows that the practical was still a success.\n",

However, unfortunately we couldn't think of a way to make it any faster as it has to go through all of the pairs which is of $O(n^2)$ complexity. On the other hand, something that is good about our practical is our investigation. Moving our report to a Jupyter Notebook made the investigation so much more clear and reproducible."
